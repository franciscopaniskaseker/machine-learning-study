Notes:

- I am not being paid to recommend paid courses. there are a lot of free content, and they are good, but sometimes you need some platform that will provide 

- I will just recommend courses that I did (at least some part). I am sure there are a lot of courses with same or better content and resources.

- Somtimes the course is not for you. Some of them are to build existing or new algorithms. Some of them are to just use and there is nothing wrong with it. Just skip them if you do not want to turn to be crazy. The content will be there for ever, so you can review anytime.

#### From Geoffrey Hinton: 

"The other advice I have is, never stop programming. Because if you give a student something to do, if they're a bad student, they'll come back and say, it didn't work. And the reason it didn't work would be some little decision they made, that they didn't realize is crucial. And if you give it to a good student, like for example. You can give him anything and he'll come back and say, it worked."

Is important to study, read, watch some videos, listen  podcasts etc. But please: NEVER STOP PROGRAMMING. If 50% of your study time is not being creating or updating code, you are probably not being efficient enough. 50% is just a random value. Pick a good number for you, but machine learning, deep learning, natural language processor etc without high experience creting code, is a waste of time. And do not waste too much time learning python if you do not know Python. Python is the tool to get access to the most important AI frameworks with maximum efficience, however you can not spend one year learning python. Be more practical you are not a college student.
