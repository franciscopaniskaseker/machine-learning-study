# how to install

using homebrew:
brew install miniforge


manually:
curl -fsSLo Miniforge3.sh "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3.sh -b -p "${HOME}/conda"
source "${HOME}/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
conda activate

# setup tensorflow with metal plugin
python -m pip install -U pip
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
python -m pip install tensorflow-macos
python -m pip install tensorflow-metal

Important:
- tensorflow does not provide support to apple silicon cpus
- tensorflow forked by apple needs to be used
- if you have any problem with training using tensorflow-metal (that uses gpu and npu), just remove tensorflow-meta package and cpu will be used
- apple tensorflow-metal package does not support complex and double types (sat 17 dec 2022)
